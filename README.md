# Python Code Collection

This is a collection of Python codes that showcases my progress and evolution in programming with Python. The codes included in this collection cover a wide range of topics, with a focus on arithmetic operations, working with strings, arrays, and dictionaries.

## Content

The following directories are included in this collection:

arithmetics: A file that contains codes related to arithmetic operations, including basic math functions, fractions, and more.

data_structures: A file that contains codes related to working with strings, arrays, and dictionaries. This includes various functions and operations related to these data structures, such as string manipulation, array sorting and filtering, and dictionary iteration and comprehension.

> There will be more specific "Read Me" files in each respective directory to explain them more detailed

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to showcase my progress in programming with Python and demonstrate my ability to work with different data structures and programming concepts. While some of the codes may be simple, they reflect my evolution as a programmer and my dedication to expanding my knowledge and skills.

### Future Updates

I plan to continue expanding this collection and adding more codes related to other programming concepts and techniques. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out and let me know.

## Prerequisites

To run these scripts, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage

To use this project, you can clone the repository using Git. First, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, you can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, enter the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Axelvazslima/practices-python <br>
This will clone the project to your local machine.

### To run any of the scripts in the project, navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run and enter the following command:

python script_name.py <br>
Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run.
OBS: This may change, if you have two versions of Python in your machine you have to specify which one you want to use, like: python3 script_name.py

## Feel free to explore the project and experiment with the different scripts!

Each one of them will provide instructions on how to use it and what input it requires.

#### Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to explore this collection of Python codes. I hope you find it useful and informative, and I look forward to continuing my evolution as a programmer.
