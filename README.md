# Python Arithmetic Operations

## This project contains a collection of Python scripts that perform a variety of arithmetic operations, including:

1) A calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2) A salary raiser calculator that can calculate an employee's new salary after a percentage raise.
3) A temperature scale measurement converter that can convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
### And many more!

## Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
To use this project, you can clone the repository using Git. First, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, you can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, enter the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Axelvazslima/arithmetics-python <br>
This will clone the project to your local machine.

### To run any of the scripts in the project, navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run and enter the following command:

python script_name.py <br>
Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to run.
OBS: This may change, if you have two versions of Python in your machine you have to specify which one you want to use, like: python3 script_name.py

Each script will provide instructions on how to use it and what input it requires.

## Feel free to explore the project and experiment with the different scripts!
Each one of them will provide instructions on how to use it and what input it requires.
